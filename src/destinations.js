The Mercurian high-speed train can take you from its sunny side to it's night side in under 3 hours, and the extreme temperature difference won't leave you bored for long! <br> This planet is also the Solar System's primary source of Nickel and Silicon, so come visit our mine open day while you're there :)",

Take a guided tour of the various rovers' burial sites, and pet our beloved Rover The Explorer 2100! <br>Please note: smuggling Matt Damon back to Earth is against the law no matter how hard he pleads. In extreme cases you may be allowed to pacify him with a Snickers bar and receive compensation of up to Â£10 for your distress",

But make sure to wear your radiation suit as the Royal School of Medicine has informed us that they do not need any more cadavers from Jupiter and are actually struggling to find a use for the 260 that we have supplied to them after the last excursion. If you do manage to survive more than 300 picoseconds on the planet, you can enjoy the magnificent auroras like nowhere else in the Solar System. Also, watch out for any suspicious black monoliths that may find themselves in the orbit, and alert the authorities immediately if you see one.",

The math nerds will enjoy studying the hexagonal storm on the planet's north pole; the chemistry enthusiasts will love the aurora borealis; and the physicists can get a lifetime of mental stimulation from the atmospheric rotation patterns and the tidal forces. If you say you love Saturn yet you do not have a doctorate in science, why don't you go to an art gallery with your love of superficial beauty instead? ",

The pressure in Uranus is also so high it makes diamond icebergs, I bet that's pretty painful. And did you know that Uranus has been examined by Hubble? That's great because I could never bend enough to do it myself (all that stargazing hurts my neck!). Because it's pretty far away, we still don't know much about Uranus, but I'm sure that soon we will be able to penetrate deeper into the layer of gas to study it's mantle and core for the benefit of asstronomy. And here's one more fun fact: the intern writing this is actually 12 years old and is more interested in making jokes than advertising this destination ",

Today, you can flex on them by paragliding in the fastest winds in the Solar System. <br>But I know the real reason you're planning to get your grubby hands on these Neptune tickets: the diamond icebergs floating all over the planet's oceans. Well, let me tell you this: you gotta make that investment first, so think of this price as a bit of insurance to make sure we don't go out of business when you greedy twats fill up your suitcases with diamonds and retire to a space villa above Venus and stop using our services because you decide to play space golf instead of travelling. No, I'm not bitter, you're bitter!",

Will you be the one to see how this love story culminates? <br>Or in case you're not into romance, objects in the Pluto system are named after figures of the Greek underworld.
